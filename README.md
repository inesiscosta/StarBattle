# Star Battle Logic Puzzle Solver
This project is a solver for [Puzzle Baron's Star Battle](https://starbattle.puzzlebaron.com) logic puzzle, implemented in Prolog, developed for my Logic for Programming class. The solver uses various strategies to place stars on a board according to specific rules.
